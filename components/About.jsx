      <p>
        I'm Florencia, I studied programing at a technical school in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
        But I learned a lot by myself, like frameworks, libraries, and other tecnologies.
        I'm currently looking for my first job experience.
        I'm intrested to work in a team where I can apply what I learned, 
        face new challenges and give my best to grow as a developer and person.
        I'm colaborative and attentive, I like to hear ideas and give mine to others to reach the best results.
        I know that I will work great in a team that has this values. 
        If you want to contact me, please send me an email, or a message on my social networks. 
        I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
